# geniter
A collection of generative iterative machine learning projects.

Why Generative? We should use AI to create stuff.
Why Iterative? We need to understand what the AI is doing.

My inspiration for this project comes from the <b>next word prediction</b> used in google GBoard and similar.

By creating models that works with iterations <b>intepretable by humans</b>, Human and artificial intellegence can collaborate, taking turns depending on what type of intellegence is best in any given situation.

*Makes repetative white collor jobs more fun and creative.
*The AI will be constantly fed with high quality data.

Under development...
