# geniter
A collection of generative iterative machine learning projects.

Why Generative? We should use AI to create stuff.
Why Iterative? We need to understand what the AI is doing.

My inspiration for this project comes from the <b>next word prediction</b> used in google GBoard and similar.

By creating models that works with iterations <b>interpretable by humans</b>, Human and artificial intelligence can collaborate, taking turns depending on what type of intelligence is best in any given situation.

Makes repetitive white collar jobs more fun and creative.

The AI will be constantly fed with high quality data.
